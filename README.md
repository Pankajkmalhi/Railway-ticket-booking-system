Our web application project, developed for the course of Software Construction and Development, focuses on creating a railway ticket booking system using Java, XML, and MySQL Workbench for the database management. The project is a collaborative effort of a two-member team.

The objective of our web application is to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly platform to book railway tickets online. By leveraging Java's robustness and versatility, we aim to create a reliable and efficient system that meets the needs of both the passengers and the railway authorities.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and securely log in to the application. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the booking system.

Ticket Booking: The core functionality of the web application revolves around allowing users to search for train routes, select their preferred travel options, and book tickets seamlessly. The system will validate seat availability, calculate fares, and generate a confirmation for successful bookings.

Seat Selection: Passengers will have the ability to choose their seats based on availability, class, and other preferences. The application will provide an intuitive interface to facilitate seat selection.

Payment Integration: The web application will integrate with popular payment gateways to offer users a variety of secure payment options. This ensures a smooth and secure transaction process for customers.

Booking Management: Users will have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view their booked tickets, make changes to their bookings (if permitted), and view past travel history.

Admin Panel: An admin panel will be developed to facilitate the management of trains, schedules, fares, and user accounts. Authorized administrators can perform tasks such as adding new trains, modifying existing schedules, and managing user accounts.

Notifications: The system will incorporate a notification system to keep users updated about their bookings, including booking confirmations, changes in schedules, or any cancellations.

Technologies:

Java: We will utilize the Java programming language to develop the core logic and functionality of the web application.
XML: XML will be used for data interchange, providing a structured format for storing and retrieving information.
MySQL Workbench: We have chosen MySQL Workbench as our database management system to efficiently store and manage all the relevant data for the ticket booking system.
By implementing this web application, we aim to enhance the efficiency and convenience of railway ticket booking, offering users a seamless experience and simplifying the overall management for the railway authorities. Our project demonstrates the application of various software development techniques and showcases our proficiency in Java, XML, and database management with MySQL Workbench.
